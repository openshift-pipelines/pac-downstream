# Code Quality and Formatting

- Always run `make fumpt` after writing Go code to ensure proper formatting
- Use `make fix-linters` to automatically fix most linting issues
- Run `make check` to verify both linting and tests pass before committing
- For markdown files, use `make fix-markdownlint` to fix formatting issues
- Use `make fix-trailing-spaces` to clean up trailing whitespace in markdown and yaml files
