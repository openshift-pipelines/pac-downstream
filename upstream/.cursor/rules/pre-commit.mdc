alwaysApply: false
---
- Install pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install` to ensure code quality
- The project uses multiple linters: golangci-lint, yamllint, markdownlint, ruff, shellcheck, vale, codespell
- Pre-commit hooks run automatically on push, but can be skipped with `git push --no-verify`
- Use `SKIP=hook-name git push` to skip specific hooks
